If we talk about the Android development then there's come application for mobile for IOS as well as for Android.

This is to understand,All programming languange can't do for both but flutter can do for both..

what is Flutter ??
DEFINATION ::--> A "Tool" or "FRAMEWORK" that allows you to build native cross-platform (ios,Android) app with 1 programming language and code base.
There is also A SDK (Software Development kit) 

FRAMEWORK MEANING??
--> Re-usable UI building blocks (widget) utility packages..

what is SDK??
--> It will convert the framework to the machine code..
